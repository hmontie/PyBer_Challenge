## PyBer_Challenge

#Overview of the analysis:

PyBer is a ride-sharing app company valued at $2.3 billion. The CEO, V. Isualize wants a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type and shown in multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city types that will help improve access to ride sharing services and determine ride affordability.

#Results:
#Quick facts by city type, seen in the image below our facts

Rural cities has the least amount of drivers, rides and total fares.
Urban cities have the most amount of drivers, rides and total fares.
Suburban cities are in the middle having the 2nd most drivers, rides and total fares.
Although Rural cities see the least amount of drivers,rides & fares the have the highest average of fare per ride and fare per driver.

#Summary:

![Total Fare by City Type](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107443962/180069266-0eaa9a3c-afcf-401d-b627-df3febb2e08a.png)

As shown in line graph above, the urban cities had the highest total fare with on the months of January to March 2019. The rual anf urban cities had the lowest fare and the low fare can be attributed to the empty cells observed in the rual cities column after arranging the data  using loc fuction. The drop in number of ride usage in the rural cities within the months of January to April, 2019 could be due tot he low number of available rides and drivers in those cities. Recommened more ride and driver which will invariably boost ride afforability. In addition, although the available data is limited to 2019, the Urban cities might also benefit from the avaible data is limited to 2019, the Urban cities might also benefit from ride with the month of January to April as this will help meet the demands for rides in those months, increase revenue and enhance affordability.

#Recommendation
In addtion to the above analysis, I would recommend obtaining more information about the demographics of those living in the three city types and addtional two to five previous year city and ride data.
